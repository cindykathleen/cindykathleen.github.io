                <h8>HOW MY SOULCYCLE STORY STARTED</h8>
                <p>I have never been a fan of exercising. I would try to make it a habit, but one or two lazy days would set me back to the beginning. Even though I knew I needed to exercise to maintain a more healthy lifestyle, I never had the passion or drive to do it.</p>
                <p>I have been hearing about SoulCylcle for a while throughout the years, but I never got around to trying it out. Then one day (1/13/18), Liv texted our group chat to see if anyone wanted to try it out with her. Leona and I expressed interest right away and we saw that there was a "BOGO" deal for first time riders. We bought our passes and started pumping each other up by signing up for our first class and learning everything there is to know about SoulCycle.</p>
                <p>After attending our first class on January 15, 2018, we were hooked.</p>
