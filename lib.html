                <p>Cheers to another spontaneous trip and memorable weekend! I wasn't planning on going to Life is Beautiful, but of course on the day of, they managed to convince me to go. Thank you Alan for purchasing my super last minute flight and my other friends for letting me stay with them in their hotel room!</p>

                <p>The Life is Beautiful Music Festival was a great event! Even though I didn't know too many of the artists playing, it was great experiencing new music and artists, and checking out the different art that was available.</p>

                <p>One of my main reasons for going on this trip in the first place: Dillon Francis was going to be playing at Encore!! He is one of Liv and I's absolute favorite DJs so we had to go. Even though it was freezing cold, we wrapped ourselves in warm towels and waited until 1am to finally see him. Was it worth it? Absolutely.</p>

                <p>Every time in Las Vegas, I HAVE TO play tourist. There are just so many exciting things to do and see there. On Saturday, our little group of four went off to explore Downtown. We went to M&amp;M World and the Coca Cola store, and rode the New York New York Roller Coaster.</p>

                <p>There's something about the food in Las Vegas that makes it taste all the more delicious. Some places that we ate at were Earl of Sandwich, Hwaro AYCE Korean BBQ, Tacos El Gordo, Shake Shack (with special guest appearance of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/foodhand_/">@foodhand_</a>), and Wicked Spoon. I wish I had a bigger stomach to try everything on the menus. I'll be back soon for more!</p>
