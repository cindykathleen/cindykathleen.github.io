                <h3>Coachella Music Festival</h3>
                <h2>April 19 - 23, 2017</h2>

                <p>They had my ticket ready and bought as soon as they went on sale, but I kept telling them that I wasn't going to go. It was a couple of days before the event when they finally decided to sell my ticket. On Wednesday, April 19, I finished taking two midterms and had some time to think.. In a few years after I graduate college, am I really going to remember taking these midterms? Or am I going to remember my sponaneous trip to Coachella with my best friends? So I decided 10 hours before they left that I was going to go. I'm extremely grateful to my friends for finding me another ticket last minute and helping me make this trip happen!</p>

                <p>After scrambling to pack and get everything ready, we were on our way to Indio, California! All 8 cars caravanned into the camp grounds and we were lucky enough to get a spot right by the entrance. Thursday was spent setting up our campsite, decorating our cars with "Carpoolchella", and exploring the vendors and art exhibits in the camp grounds.</p>

                <p>The three day music festival was an unforgettable experience. I got to see some of my favorites like Dillon Francis and Martin Garrix, and experience new artists like Gryffin and Broods. All of the statues and exhibits sponsored by various companies and organizations were also very creative and engaging. Even though the food was CRAZY expensive, there was a lot of variety and unique options.</p>

                <p>It was the best way to spend the weekend with my friends and make new friends. Nothing brings people closer together than suffering through the 100 degree desert heat and sitting by the outlets for hours waiting for all of the phones to charge. I can't wait to go back in 2019 for Coachella's 20th Anniversary!</p>
