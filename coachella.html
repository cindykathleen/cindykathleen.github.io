                <p>They had my ticket ready and bought as soon as they went on sale, but I kept telling them that I wasn't going to go. It was a couple of days before the event when they finally decided to sell my ticket. On Wednesday, April 19, I finished taking two midterms and had some time to think.. In a few years after I graduate college, am I really going to remember taking these midterms? Or am I going to remember my sponaneous trip to Coachella with my best friends? So I decided 10 hours before they left that I was going to go. I'm extremely grateful to my friends for finding me another ticket last minute and helping me make this trip happen!</p>

                <p>After scrambling to pack and get everything ready, we were on our way to Indio, California! All 8 cars caravanned into the camp grounds and we were lucky enough to get a spot right by the entrance. Thursday was spent setting up our campsite, decorating our cars with "Carpoolchella", and exploring the vendors and art exhibits in the camp grounds.</p>
